               <li>As newcomers, the field of video editing can seem everlasting and sometimes even tedious. However, in the modern world, the need and number of video editors is increasing at a rapid pace. All visual content that is consumed by us has been edited by a professional video editor. In the post-production process, video editing is the most important component. Actors can act, camerapersons can shoot, but it is the job of the video editor to connect those shots and tell a story. We hope that this resource guide will be able to get you through the basics of this craft and push you into editing your own videos.
